# Deep-Learning

In this assignment I explored a few important concepts used in the deep learning projects:
- Training image classification algorithms using Deep Learning
- Dataset Analyses
- Testing deep learning classifier with the test data
- Fine-tuning / Transfer Learning

I used the Fashion MNIST dataset that is provided by Keras. I also worked with pretrained models, which was downloaded from keras applications.
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of  article images from a e-commerce website named zalando with 70,000 images of size (28x28x1) each belonging to one of the 10 classes.
Pretrained Models can be found at https://keras.io/applications/#applications
